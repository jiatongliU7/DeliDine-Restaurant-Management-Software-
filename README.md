DeliDineSoft is a **restaurant management application** designed for both managers and employees to improve efficiency, communication, and scheduling in the workplace.  
The app focuses on **ease of use**, **real-time updates**, and **secure authentication**, ensuring smooth day-to-day operations for restaurants.

The software was collaboratively developed by a **team of three**, with my main focus on:
